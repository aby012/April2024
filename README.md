# This Is Not A Dinosaur
_Jurassic or Just-a-pic? Let our Dino-Detective decide!_

## What's this?!
It's more than just an appâ€”it's a glimpse into the prehistoric world, a journey through pixels and patterns to uncover the ancient giants that once roamed the Earth. In simple words, this app accepts an image from the user and detects if any Dinosaurs are present in that image.

## But why!
For fun...and a bit more. I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 20 years of work experience. However, off late my search for a job has not proved to be quite fruitful. Doubts started creeping in and I started to question my ability as a coder, and I shied away from publishing any of the apps that I had created lately. And then one fine night while doom-scrolling through Reddit I found something interesting. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bg8vc/comment/c0mmeos/). It inspired me to start afresh, to start with something simple, something fun. And [THIS IS NOT A DINOSAUR](https://thisisnotadinosaur.streamlit.app/) was born.

## Noice, isn't it? What can you do?
Simple. Let me know what do you think about this; whether you like it, hate it, had fun with it, broke it, anything. As Thor Odinson said, it would make me feel that "I'm still worthy!" You are also welcome to contribute if you want. And if you are feeling generous, consider donating so that I can continue to create more apps like this.
