# This Is Not A Dinosaur
_Jurassic or Just-a-pic? Let our Dino-Detective decide!_

## What's this?!
This is a simple app that accepts an image from the user and detects if any Dinosaus are present in that image.

## But why!
For fun! ... err, not really. I am a Machine Learning Engineer with around 20 years of work experience. I have created a number of apps but I am too afraid to release them. It's because I have been searching for a job but not finding any, which made me think do I really know coding at all. So I thought about starting simple, and that's how this was created. BTW, [here's where I got the inspiration from](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bg8vc/comment/c0mmeos/).

## Noice! What can I do?
Simple. Let me know what do you think about this on the GitHub repository for this app; whether you like it, had fun with it, anything. It would work as a moral booster for me. Feel free to contribute if you want. If you are feeling generous, consider donating so that I can continue to create more apps like this.
